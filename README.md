# Human-Wildlife Conflict Projects

This repository contains code and data for various projects related to human-wildlife conflict. The main goal of this repository is to share a most of the code used in the projects, allowing users to review the work done, ask questions, and potentially improve the code or apply it to other related projects.

## Repository Structure

- `Rmd`: This folder contains R Markdown files that serve as an index of the code used in the [Human-wildlife conflict in the Limpopo National Park](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.19459.99361) project. These files provide an overview of the code structure and functionality. Please note that the complete codebase and data are not available in this repository.

- `Functions`: This folder contains separate R files for each custom function.

The `1_4All.R`, `2_4All.R`, `3_4All.R`, and `4_4All.R` files are scripts that demonstrates how to use some of the functions for a specific case. 
The rest of this public repository is an ongoing project, and we welcome collaborators who are interested in contributing to this work or any related project.

## Limitations

This public repository contains only a subset of the code used in the projects. The complete codebase and data are available in a separate private repository. As a result, some parts of the code or project context might be missing, which could lead to potential misunderstandings or misinterpretations of the work. We encourage users to contact me if they have any questions or need access to the full private repository.
