# Human-Wildlife Conflict Projects

This repository contains code and data for various projects related to human-wildlife conflict. The main goal of this repository is to share a portion of the code used in the projects, allowing users to review the work done, ask questions, and potentially improve the code or apply it to other related projects.

## Repository Structure

- `Rmd`: This folder contains R Markdown files that serve as an index of the code used in the [Human-wildlife conflict in the Limpopo National Park](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.19459.99361) project. These files provide an overview of the code structure and functionality. Please note that the complete codebase and data are not available in this repository.

## Limitations

This public repository contains only a subset of the code used in the projects. The complete codebase and data are available in a separate private repository. As a result, some parts of the code or project context might be missing, which could lead to potential misunderstandings or misinterpretations of the work. We encourage users to contact me if they have any questions or need access to the full private repository.

## Contact

If you have any questions, need more information, or would like access to the full private repository, please feel free to contact me at jessicabernal@uma.es.
